## Public APIs

This is a simple interface to Dave Machado's [Public API for Public APIs.](https://github.com/davemachado/public-api)

I noticed that he had the list arranged in categories, and being lazy, as I am, I thought it would be nice to get a list of all the entries by category on a whim.

Clicking on the API links puts them in the iframe, for those that do not have `X-Frame-Options` set to `DENY`.

This is a really simple HTML, JS, CSS page.

Might be an interesting exercise to dress it up a bit using React and/or React Native. And also figure out how to open a new tab or page for the links that cannot open in the `iframe`.
